I'm currently working full-time as a Data Scientist at [Home Team Science and Technology Agency](https://www.htx.gov.sg) (HTX) in Singapore. Outside of full-time work, I also do research as a hobby in the following (non-exhaustive) areas:

* Natural language processing - tokenization/modelling
* Graph neural networks

I graduated with a BEng (Hons) in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.
